         Venezuela overflows with natural wonders,
         including the world's highest waterfall: the 3,212-foot cascades of Angel Falls,
         located in the UNESCO-protected Canaima National Park. Canaima is by far the country's most popular attraction,
         and the falls stretch an astounding 19 times higher than Niagara Falls. Bonus: 
         Pixar animators used the location as inspiration for Paradise Falls in Up—so you know it's good.
