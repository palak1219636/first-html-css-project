            Antelope Canyon is a slot canyon (and serious Instagram darling) in the American Southwest. 
            Its Navajo name translates to “the place where water runs through rocks”—an allusion to the canyon’s 
            creation through erosion. The narrow, undulating spaces between rock formations allow for vivid patterns
            when sunlight filters through the striated stone.
