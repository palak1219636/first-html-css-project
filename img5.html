        Greenland is icy, mysterious, and one of the most naturally beautiful places on the planet.
        The world's biggest non-continental island is so much more than glaciers, 
        too (although the glaciers are spectacular)—think 
        magnificent fjords, colorful villages, fields of sheep, and that ever-alluring midnight sun.
        In prehistoric times, Greenland was home to several successive Paleo-Inuit cultures 
        known today primarily through archaeological finds. The earliest entry of the Paleo-Inuit into 
        Greenland is thought to have occurred about 2500 BC. From around 2500 BC to 800 BC, southern and 
        western Greenland were inhabited by the Saqqaq culture. Most finds of Saqqaq-period archaeological
        remains have been around Disko Bay, including the site of Saqqaq, after which the culture is named.
        Greenland, the world’s largest island, the vast majority are Inuit, 
        and almost a quarter live in the capital city, Nuuk. The rest of the country is 
        made up of smaller towns and isolated coastal settlements in which people still 
        rely on traditional methods of hunting and fishing for fish, seal, and whale meat.
